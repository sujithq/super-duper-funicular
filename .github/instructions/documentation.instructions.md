### Inline Documentation
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates energy efficiency as the ratio of consumption to production.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="production">Total energy produced in kWh</param>
/// <param name="consumption">Total energy consumed in kWh</param>
/// <returns>Efficiency percentage (0-100+)</returns>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// var efficiency = CalculateEfficiency(20.5, 18.2); // Returns ~88.8%
/// </code>
/// </example>
public double CalculateEfficiency(double production, double consumption)
```
